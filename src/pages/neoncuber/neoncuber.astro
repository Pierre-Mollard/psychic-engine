        description="NeonCuber is a fusion of the classic Rubik's Cube logic with modern match-3 games like Candy Crush. Slide, rotate, and match colors as you navigate vibrant 3D shapes made of interconnected cubes. Each puzzle is filled with glowing neon hues and fresh challenges. Every level introduces new combinations and patterns to solve: matching identical faces, triggering chain reactions, racing against timers, earning score multipliers, and more."
